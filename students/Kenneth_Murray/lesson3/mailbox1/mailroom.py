"""Send a Thank You"""
#If the user types ‘list’, show them a list of the donor names and re-prompt
#If the user types a name not in the list, add that name to the data structure and use it.
#If the user types a name in the list, use it.
#Once a name has been selected, prompt for a donation amount.
#Turn the amount into a number – it is OK at this point for the program to crash if someone types a bogus amount.
#Once an amount has been given, add that amount to the donation history of the selected user.
#compose an email thanking the donor for their generous donation. Print the email to the terminal and return to the original prompt.


"""Create a Report"""
#print a list of your donors, sorted by total historical donation amount.
#Include Donor Name, total donated, number of donations and average donation
#After printing this report, return to the original prompt.
#At any point, the user should be able to quit their current task and return to the original prompt.
#From the original prompt, the user should be able to quit the script cleanly.
